# xMKCKKS
Multi‚Äêkey homomorphic encryption based on MKCKKS
HEAAN is a software library that implements homomorphic encryption (HE) that supports fixed point arithmetics. This library supports approximate operations between rational numbers. The approximate error depends on some parameters and almost same with floating point operation errors.
